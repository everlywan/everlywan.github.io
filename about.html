                <h1>Personal Summary</h1>
                <p>I immigrated to the U.S. in 2022 and became a student at Cherry Creek High School in Colorado. I’m proud of the academic 
                    record I’ve built—earning A’s in each single class, maintaining a 4.375 weighted GPA and a 4.000 unweighted GPA—but grades 
                    alone don’t define me.                   
                   <br><br>
                   What defines me is the way I respond to unfamiliarity—with curiosity, and with quiet persistence. Whether it was adapting 
                   to a new language, navigating cultural differences, or asking my first question in an American classroom, I’ve learned to 
                   face discomfort not with fear, but with a kind of creative patience. I challenge myself constantly and never stop exploring 
                   new things. I joined FBLA for the first time this year—and walked away with first-place awards at both the school and 
                   district levels. More than the trophy, I’m proud of the confidence I built in the process. I still remember when public 
                   speaking made me tremble. Now, I speak with clarity and purpose, not because I was born confident, but because I earned it.
                   <br><br>
                   Outside of class, I write novels, draw digitally, and create educational videos on YouTube, teaching math, science, economics, 
                   and vocabulary—over 100 videos and counting. I believe learning doesn’t stop at the edge of a desk. It travels, it echoes, 
                   and it lifts others. That’s why I’ve also volunteered for the past three years at Denver Rescue Mission and served as a 
                   Chinese language assistant—because sharing knowledge teaches me patience, empathy, and human connection.
                   <br><br>
                   My aim isn’t just to be a great student. It’s to become someone who makes the world better—through education, creativity, 
                   and responsibility. I don’t try to be the loudest voice in the room. I try to be the one who listens deeply, leads quietly, 
                   and builds things that matter. I believe that wherever I go next, any college that truly sees me will see not just what I’ve done, 
                   but who I’ve become—and everything I still have to give.
                   <br><br>
                   That’s what makes me, me.
