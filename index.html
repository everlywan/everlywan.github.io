        <h1>Athletics</h1>
        <p>I have a deep passion for athletics and an active lifestyle. I regularly participate in various sports and events, including Bolder Boulder 10K
            running race and dragon boat competition In addition to these exciting challenges, I maintain a consistent routine of running twice a week, 
            which keeps me energized and focused.

                <h3>Bolder Boulder 10K</h3>
                <p>The Bolder Boulder is an annual 10-kilometer run in Boulder, Colorado. The 2007 race featured over 54,000 runners, 
                    making it the second largest largest 10k race in the US and the fifth largest road race in the world.</p>

                <a href="/athletic"><img src="static/styles/images/dragonboat2.jpg"></a>
                <h3>Dragon Boat Race</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite cultural events is the annual Dragon Boat Race, which I’ve participated in and enjoyed deeply. 
                    Dragon boat racing is more than just a sport—it’s a vibrant tradition rooted in the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival, or Duanwu Jie. 
                    This festival honors the ancient poet Qu Yuan and is celebrated by racing long, narrow boats in rhythmic unison to the beat of drums. 
                    I love the energy of the race, the teamwork it demands, and the cultural pride it inspires. Paddling together with others, 
                    feeling the water rush by, and hearing the crowd cheer—it’s an unforgettable experience that connects me not only to my heritage, 
                    but also to a larger community. For me, the dragon boat race isn’t just about winning—it’s about spirit, tradition, and joy.

                <h3>Running</h3>
                <p>Running has always been a part of who I am. It’s more than just a form of exercise—it’s a commitment I’ve kept to myself over the years. 
                    I run twice a week, usually for about two hours each session, not out of obligation, but because it brings me clarity, strength, 
                    and a sense of peace. Every summer, I also participate in the Bolder Boulder 10K event, which has become a personal tradition 
                    and a way to celebrate my passion for running alongside a larger community. Whether I’m training alone or running with thousands, 
                    this is where I feel most focused, most free, and most myself.

                <h3>Voice Acting</h3>
                <p>I have a deep passion for voice acting, a journey I began when I was 11 years ago in my elementary school, starting with simple
                    sentences, songs, and movies before progressing to classic films I truly enjoy the process, often dedicating hours to perfecting
                     my craft. Voice acting not only helps me speak more naturally but also allows me to connect deeply with the characters in every movie.

                <h3>My Book</h3>
                <p>I've written two novels, and this is the the second one, though it's the only one I've published. Inspired by my uncle, who wrote his own
                    book, I decided to start writing as well I completed the first 10 sections of this novel while I was in middle school and finished the rest
                    during high school. Since I love drawing, I also created all the illustrations for the book. I hope you enjoy it.

                <p>Like many kids, I've always enjoyed drawing. I'm passionate about it and have spent several years practicing different styles, including
                    sketching, quick sketches, cartoons, watercolor painting, and oil painting. I even like to add little drawings to my notes whenever
                    inspiration strikes.

                    helped me make new firends but also taught me how to contribute effectively in a team.

                <p>In high shcool, I chose to focus on programming courses, where I first explored game development through Java processing. I practiced extensively,
                    creating small games with Java, a powerful and versatile language. I especially enjoy the satisfaction of debugging and making progress in my
                    projects. I also participated in district and state-level Computer Programming Competitions, earning several awards along the way.

        <h1>What Our Teaches Say</h1>
        <p>I have the privilege of meeting many amazing teachers in high school. They encouraged and supported me, helping me grow and succeed. When I moved to
            the US, I faced many challenges adjusting to the pace and improving my language skills. While voice acting helped me significantly, I still dedicated
            a lot of time to learning and self-improvement I'm deeply grateful to my teachers, who not only imparted knowledge but also offered encouragement
            and made me feel truly supported and cared for.

Everly is a diligent and focused individual who approaches her studies with a level of seriousness that is commendable; she consistently puts in extra effort, whether it be through preparation for assignments or seeking out additional resources to deepen her understanding of the material.

Everly has a tenacity that is unmatched; she never gives up, even when the material becomes particularly complex. This resilience is a quality that will undoubtedly serve her well in her future academic endeavors.

                        <br><br>Most high school students are not willing to put in the slightest extra effort to achieve deeper learning and Everly was willing to put an immense amount of extra work to translate assignments and outperform students that have every advantage. 
                        <br><br>She is incredibly thoughtful, kind, and advocates for herself. She will be a great addition to any university or community that she is a part of.

                        Everly is the most sincere, thoughtful learner in my English 11 classes. She cares deeply about not only learning the language with more fluency, but she strives to understand the content fully.
<br><br>
Everly asks thoughtful, insightful questions as well as contributes astute comments during class discussions. She's an invaluable asset to our learning environment.
<br><br>
Everly respects the dignity of each individual around her—no matter their beliefs, understanding of language, or current level of academic success. Everly is inclusive and accepting of all of her peers.
<br><br>
Everly is studious and academically focused. She takes control of her learning, putting in more effort than most not only because she's still perfecting her command of English, but also because of her genuine will and desire to be the best version of her intellectual self.

                        Everly Wan is one of the most mathematically gifted and driven students I’ve had the pleasure to work with. Her passion for mathematics is evident not only in her classroom performance but also in her ambitious course load—completing six year-long math classes during her four years of high school. 
                        <br><br>Remarkably, she doubled up on math courses in her sophomore year and is planning to do so again in senior year, a rare path that demonstrates both vision and grit. 
                        <br><br>Everly has earned consistent A and A+ grades across all her math courses, from foundational topics to advanced problem-solving. Her analytical thinking, perseverance, and attention to detail consistently set her apart. 
                        <br><br>Beyond her academic record, Everly brings curiosity and humility to every challenge, approaching even the most complex topics with enthusiasm and discipline. She is a remarkable student whose mathematical talent and work ethic will shine in any university setting.
